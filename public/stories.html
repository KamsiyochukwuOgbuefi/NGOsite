              Amara was only fourteen when her village was struck by a violent
              terrorist attack. In the chaos, she was separated from her family
              and left with injuries that would take months to heal. Yet today,
              she stands as a symbol of quiet strength—rebuilding her life
              through counseling, education support, and a community of
              survivors who refuse to give up hope. Her journey reminds us that
              behind every crisis is a resilient human spirit.

            <p>
              Amara was only 14 when her village in northern Nigeria was
              attacked at night. She remembers the sound of doors breaking, the
              rush of people running, and the sudden darkness filled with smoke.
              In the chaos, she was separated from her mother and younger
              brother. Amara survived with injuries to her leg and severe
              emotional trauma. For weeks she could not speak, often waking in
              tears from nightmares. Through the NGO’s trauma-healing center,
              she began counseling sessions, received medical support, and was
              placed in a safe learning program. Today, Amara is back in school
              and dreams of becoming a nurse. She says, “I survived, but healing
              didn’t start until someone cared enough to help me find my voice
              again.”

              Grace escaped a violent attack, but the emotional wounds remained
              long after the chaos ended. She battled anxiety, nightmares, and a
              constant sense of fear that affected her daily life and education.
              Through trauma counseling, peer support groups, and mental-health
              resources provided by the NGO, she gradually learned to regain
              control and trust again. Today, Grace advocates for emotional

            <p>
              Grace was seventeen when violence struck her community. Though she
              escaped without physical injuries, the emotional impact followed
              her for months. She struggled with constant fear, sudden panic
              attacks, and recurring nightmares that made sleep almost
              impossible. Her grades dropped, and she withdrew from friends
              because she didn’t know how to explain what she was feeling.
              Through the NGO’s trauma-healing program, Grace received
              counseling, attended group therapy, and learned coping tools to
              manage anxiety. With time, she regained confidence, returned fully
              to school, and found comfort in connecting with others who had
              lived through similar experiences. Grace says, “I didn’t look
              hurt, but inside I was breaking. Counseling helped me put the
              pieces back together.”

            <p>
              Daniel was a farmer and church youth leader. One early morning,
              his community was attacked, forcing families to flee into the
              nearby forest. Daniel helped guide several children to safety, but
              by the time the attack ended, his home and farm had been burned to
              the ground. With no shelter, food, or source of income, Daniel
              struggled to support his wife and newborn child. The NGO provided
              emergency food assistance, temporary shelter materials, and
              agricultural support for displaced farmers. Daniel later joined a
              skills-training program where he learned carpentry, which now
              helps him earn a steady income for his family. He shares, “I lost
              everything I owned, but not my will to stand again.”

            <p>
              Naomi, a widowed mother of three, lost her husband during an
              attack on their village. Left alone, she struggled to protect her
              children and provide for them. The NGO helped Naomi access trauma
              counseling, food relief, and later enrolled her in a
              skills-empowerment program where she learned tailoring. With a
              sewing machine provided through the empowerment grant, she now
              runs a small business and cares for her family independently. “My
              life ended the day I lost my husband,” Naomi says, “but it started
              again when I learned I could stand on my own.”
